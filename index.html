Hello, my name is Elise Bryant. I am an uprising junior at Alameda High School. In 
the summer of 2016 I attended a 7 week coding class called Girls Who Code at the
Twitter Head Quarter in San Fransisco. Girls Who Code is a summer immersion program 
where young women can learn the basics of coding. During this program, I got to 
experience scratch, pthyon, pygame, robotics, html, css, and javascript. Many thanks
Reshma Saujani, the CEO and founder of Girls Who Code ,who has made me one of the 
10,000 girls in this program, along with the many great opportunities and wonderful 
rexperiences and Twitter for providing the space!

Artist Shepard Fairey created the an image 
of Barack Obama using these specific colors
during the 2008 Presidential Campaign. It 
is one of the most recognizable images of 
the campaign. I have recreated it using a 
picture of Beyonce.

<h5>I worked on a program called scratch, where I had to create a paddle ball 
    game. The game consist of a ball bouncing off the walls with a "paddle"
	at the bottom sliding along the x-axis keeping the ball from touching the
	bottom. If you would like to play. 
	Click <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/116638247/"> here</a>. Good Luck!!!</h5>
